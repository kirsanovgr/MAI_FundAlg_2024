At the seaside, a green oak stands,
A golden chain upon it hangs.
By day and night, a learned cat
Walks round the chain, and that is that.

He walks to the right — a song he sings,
To the left — a tale he brings.
There are wonders there: the leshy roams,
The mermaid sits upon the boughs and gloams.

On unknown paths, strange creatures tracks,
A hut on chicken legs stands back.
The forest and valley full of dreams,
At dawn, the waves upon the sand it seems,

Thirty knights, glorious and bright,
From waters clear, emerge in light.
With them their sea-uncle comes along,
And the prince passes by, so strong.

A dragon is caught, a prince so brave,
A sorcerer carries a hero to save.
The princess in the dungeon sighs,
And the brown wolf is loyal, no lies.

A witch's hut, with Baba Yaga,
Moves on its own, without a stop.
Koschei the Deathless guards his gold,
And the Russian spirit, it is bold!

I’ve been there, drank honey sweet,
Saw the oak by the sea, and its feat,
The learned cat by it did sit,
Telling me stories, every bit.
