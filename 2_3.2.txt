[Verse 1: Doja Cat]
They said, "Doja hit so sticky," I said, "Thank you very much"
Bent the whole world over and said, "Spank you very much"
Cheese like pizzeria
Have a seat, bitch, please, Ikea
From the Westside like Maria
I'm hot like grits, Madea
Beat the pussy up, call PETA
I rock the boat like Aaliyah (Ayy)
I rock a bob like Sia (Ayy)
Doja on deck, bitch, re-up (Ayy)
Thick in the thigh, thick in the waist
Thick in the right motherfuckin' places
Hits like Venus, Serena (Ayy)
He wanna eat up the caesar (Ayy)
Bonita, bonita, bonita (Ayy)
Baby girl needed the wiener (Ayy)
Dug in the guts and I skeet her (Ayy)
Arena, arena, arena (Hey)
I'm in the hall, Regina
I'm on the wall at Genius
I am the wiz, the teacher
Skinny legend like Wiz Khalifa (Woo)

[Verse 2: Rico Nasty]
They said, "Rico, you so nasty," I said, "Thank you very much" (Yeah)
He just wanna eat me like some candy, but I'm not his buttercup
These hoes swear that they can't stand me
But ain't never pullin' up (Um)
I just made a hundred K in two weeks
Lil' bitch, do you need me to pull it up? (Duh)
Big black trucks and we pullin' up (Bitch)
She drank so much, now she throwin' it up
But we don't give a fuck, we still rollin' it up
I got a lot of money, but a lot ain't enough
Park where I want, they ain't towin' us (Bitch)
I-I make the jokes, you ain't trollin' us (Bitch)
My neck is on ice, you ain't cold as us
And when we hop out, yeah, you know it's us
My-my chopper sing like Sia (Sia)
Make a bitch sick, diarrhea (Ew)
Dressed in all black, grim reaper (Bitch)
Don't act like you can't see us (Yeah)
Ride-ridin' in a foreign, no Prius
He keep callin' my phone, Nokia
So I put the nigga on speaker
If you got a problem, better speak up
[Chorus: Doja Cat]
Hair grow long like Chia
Money go long like Nia
I am the big idea
My twins big like Tia
My twins big like Tia, Tamera (Uh, wait)
Tia, Tamera (Uh, wait)
Tia, Tamera (Uh, wait)
Tia, Tamera
Hair grow long like Chia
Money go long like Nia
I am the big idea
My twins big like Tia
My twins big like Tia, Tamera (Uh, wait)
Tia, Tamera (Uh, wait)
Tia, Tamera (Uh, wait)
Tia, Tamera
